# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

This project is configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA). PWAs provide a number of advantages, such as the ability to work offline, run background tasks, and be installed on the user's device.

To add PWA capabilities to your Angular project, run `ng add @angular/pwa`. This command will create a `manifest.json` file, add a service worker, and make other necessary configurations.

Remember, service workers and PWAs only work over HTTPS or on `localhost` for development, so you'll need to deploy your app to a server with HTTPS to see the PWA features in a production environment.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
