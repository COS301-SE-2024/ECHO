# Architectural Requirements Document

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed architecture specification for the ECHO Progressive Web App (PWA). The architecture is designed to ensure scalability, maintainability, and high performance while meeting the quality requirements of usability, reliability, and security.

## Architectural Design Strategy

### Choice of Strategy
We have chosen the decomposition strategy for our architectural design. This strategy allows us to break down the system into smaller, manageable components, each with specific responsibilities. This approach facilitates parallel development, easier maintenance, and scalability. Additionally, decomposition aligns well with our use of modular frameworks like Angular and Nest.js.

### Justification
- **Maintainability:** Smaller components are easier to manage, debug, and update.
- **Scalability:** Independent components can be scaled individually based on load and performance requirements.
- **Parallel Development:** Teams can work on different components simultaneously without causing conflicts.
- **Flexibility:** Changes in one component have minimal impact on others, allowing for easier implementation of new features.

## Architectural Strategies

### Layered Architecture
The system is designed using a combination of Layered Architecture, Model-View-Controller (MVC), and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). The architecture is divided into the following layers:
- Presentation Layer
- API Layer
- Business Layer
- Data Layer

Each layer has specific responsibilities and interacts with other layers through well-defined interfaces.

#### Justification for Layered Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a specific responsibility, making the system easier to understand and manage.
- **Reusability:** Components within a layer can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Maintainability:** Changes in one layer do not affect other layers, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
- **Layered Security and Access Control:** Security measures can be implemented at multiple layers, and different layers can enforce access controls, ensuring that only authorised users can access certain parts of the application. 
- **interoperability:** Each layer can be designed to interact with external systems and services, facilitating seamless integration and data exchange. 

### Model-View-Controller (MVC)
The MVC pattern divides the application into three main components:
- **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.
- **View:** Handles the display and user interface.
- **Controller:** Processes the user input and interacts with the Model and View

#### Justification for MVC
- **Separation of Concerns:** MVC separates the application into distinct components, making it easier to develop, test and maintain.
- **Reusability:** Views and Models can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Ease of Testing:** Individual components can be tested independently, improving overall testability.
- **Encapsulation:** Sensitive business logic is encapsulated within the Mode, protecting it from direct user interaction. 

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
SOA structures the application as a collection of services that communicate over a network. Each service performs a specific business function and can be reused across different applications. 

#### Justification for SOA
- **Reusability:** Services can be reused in multiple applications, reducing duplication and effort.
- **Scalability:** Services can be scaled independently to handle varying loads.
- **Interoperability:** Standardised communication protocols allow services to interact across different platforms and technologies. 
- **Service Contracts:** Security can be managed at the service level, enabling centralised control over authentication, authorisation and encryption.
- **Fault Isolation:** Failures in one service do not necessarily impact other services, enhancing overall reliability of the system.
- **Interoperability:** Standardised communication protocols allow services to interact across different platforms and technologies. 

### Microservices
Microservices structures applications as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services within our AI system. Each service has a unique function and can be scaled individually as needed.

#### Justification for Microservices
- **Modularity:** Each module is independently developed and maintained, allowing them to work autonomously and be updated without affecting others.
- **Scalability:** Individual services can be scaled as needed without impacting the other services.
- **Fault Isolation:** If a failure occurs in one module, the entire system will not be affected and can continue running.
- **Performance Optimisation:** Services can be optimised independently based on their resource needs. 

## Quality Requirements

### Usability
1. **Intuitive Interface:** The application should be intuitive and easy to navigate, clear and organized without any unnecessary clutter. Design choices should be consistent throughout the interface, and clear visual cues (such as icons, buttons, and labels) should guide users through the interface logically and intuitively.
2. **User-Friendly:** The application should be responsive, personalisable, and easy to learn. Users should be able to customize their interface and receive clear, real-time feedback (loading indicators, confirmation, and error messages) from the system to understand the application's state and any actions they need to take.

### Performance
1. **Load Time and Responsiveness:** The application should load requested pages quickly, and the system should respond promptly when the user interacts with anything on a page.
2. **Scalability:** The system should be able to support large amounts of user traffic without significant latency.

### Reliability
1. **Error Handling:** The system should be able to identify errors and handle them quickly and gracefully, and provide meaningful feedback to users.
2. **Data Accuracy:** Data validation rules should be implemented to ensure user input is consistent and error-free, and that incorrect data is not entered into the system.

### Security
1. **Data Protection:** All user data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest, ensuring sensitive information is never exposed within the system.
2. **Authentication:** Secure methods should be used for user authentication, including multi-factor authentication.
3. **Authorization:** Ensure role-based access control to protect sensitive app features.

### Interoperability
1. **Integration:** The system should be capable of integrating seamlessly with other systems and applications, allowing data exchange and interactions without compatibility issues. 
2. **Data Exchange:** The system should support common data formats to enable smooth data exchange between different systems and services. 

### Maintainability
1. **Separation of Concerns:** The systemâ€™s codebase is modular, adhering to a clear separation of concerns (e.g., using MVC). This ensures that different parts of the system can be modified independently without affecting unrelated components, making it easier to maintain and update. 
2. **System Independence:** Each module has minimal dependencies on others, allowing individual components to be updated, tested, or replaced without requiring extensive changes to the entire system. This reduces downtime and makes bug fixing or feature development more efficient.

### Accessibility
1. **PWA Functionality:** The application implements Progressive Web App (PWA) features to provide a native app-like experience, including offline access, fast loading, and the ability to be installed on user devices. This ensures the app remains accessible even when there is limited connectivity.
2. **Use of Different Providers:** The application provides compatibility with a range of music service providers, such as Spotify, YouTube and Deezer, to ensure users can access the system using any type of account.
3. **UI Customisation:** Users are able to customise the user interface to meet their needs, such as changing the theme/UI colour for better contrast or to adjust colour sensitivity, to provide an inclusive experience for users with colour sensitivity or colour blindness.
4. **Smooth UI Transiton:** The UI should offer smooth transitions between the different mood themes, easing the effect of the colour change on users with colour-sensitivity and epilepsy.
