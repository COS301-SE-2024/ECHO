# Architectural Requirements Document

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed architecture specification for the ECHO Progressive Web App (PWA). The architecture is designed to ensure scalability, maintainability, and high performance while meeting the quality requirements of usability, reliability, and security.

## Architectural Design Strategy

### Choice of Strategy
We have chosen the decomposition strategy for our architectural design. This strategy allows us to break down the system into smaller, manageable components, each with specific responsibilities. This approach facilitates parallel development, easier maintenance, and scalability. Additionally, decomposition aligns well with our use of modular frameworks like Angular and Nest.js.

### Justification
- **Maintainability:** Smaller components are easier to manage, debug, and update.
- **Scalability:** Independent components can be scaled individually based on load and performance requirements.
- **Parallel Development:** Teams can work on different components simultaneously without causing conflicts.
- **Flexibility:** Changes in one component have minimal impact on others, allowing for easier implementation of new features.

## Architectural Strategies

### Layered Architecture
The system is designed using a combination of Layered Architecture, Model-View-Controller (MVC), and Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). The architecture is divided into the following layers:
- Presentation Layer
- API Layer
- Business Layer
- Data Layer

Each layer has specific responsibilities and interacts with other layers through well-defined interfaces.

### Justification for Layered Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a specific responsibility, making the system easier to understand and manage.
- **Reusability:** Components within a layer can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Maintainability:** Changes in one layer do not affect other layers, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

## Quality Requirements

### Usability
1. **Intuitive Interface:** The application should be intuitive and easy to navigate, clear and organized without any unnecessary clutter. Design choices should be consistent throughout the interface, and clear visual cues (such as icons, buttons, and labels) should guide users through the interface logically and intuitively.
2. **User-Friendly:** The application should be responsive, personalizable, and easy to learn. Users should be able to customize their interface and receive clear, real-time feedback (loading indicators, confirmation, and error messages) from the system to understand the application's state and any actions they need to take.

### Performance
1. **Load Time and Responsiveness:** The application should load requested pages quickly, and the system should respond promptly when the user interacts with anything on a page.
2. **Scalability:** The system should be able to support large amounts of user traffic without significant latency.

### Reliability
1. **Error Handling:** The system should be able to identify errors and handle them quickly and gracefully, and provide meaningful feedback to users.
2. **Data Accuracy:** Data validation rules should be implemented to ensure user input is consistent and error-free, and that incorrect data is not entered into the system.

### Security
1. **Data Protection:** All user data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest, ensuring sensitive information is never exposed within the system.
2. **Authentication:** Secure methods should be used for user authentication, including multi-factor authentication.
3. **Authorization:** Ensure role-based access control to protect sensitive app features.
