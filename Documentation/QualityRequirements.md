# Quality Requirements Specification

## Introduction
This document specifies the quality requirements for a music recommendation Progressive Web App (PWA), outlining the criteria we have identified for the project to ensure a high quality, reliable and secure user experience. 

## Quality Goals

### Usability
1. **Intuitive Interface:** The application should be intuitive and easy to navigate, clear and organised without any unnecessary clutter. Design choices should be consistent throughout the interface, and clear visual cues (such as icons, buttons and labels) should guide users through the interface logically and intuitively.
2. **User-Friendly:** 

### Performance
1. **Load Time and Responsiveness:** The application should load requested pages quickly, and the system should response promptly when the user interacts with anything on a page.
2. **Scalability:** The system should be able to support large amounts of user traffic without significant latency.

## Reliability
1. **Error Handling:** The system should be able to identify errors and handle them quickly and gracefully, and provide meaningful feedback to users.
2. **Data Accuracy:** Data validation rules should be implemented to ensure user input is consistent and error-free, and that incorrect data is not entered into the system. 

## Security
1. **Data Protection:** All user data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest, ensuring sensitive information is never exposed within the system.
2. **Authentication:** Secure methods should be used for user authentication, including multi-factor authentication.
3. **Authorisation:** Ensure role-based access control to protect sensitive app features.
