## About Me

As a final year Computer Science student, I'm
passionate about Data Science and Cybersecurity. I
double as the Volunteer & Training Coordinator at
YFU South Africa, leading and coordinating their
pool of volunteers and pioneering projects since
2021. Outside of my studies and work, I thrive on
continuous learning and self-development! This can
be seen in my hobbies of debating, weight-lifting
and language acquisition (qualified with my JLPT
N5). My managerial and critical thinking skills qualify
me to manage teams, communicate with clients and
meet project deadlines. I am a quick learner and
love taking on new challenges. I have a commitment
to excellence and make significant contributions in
any endeavour I undertake
